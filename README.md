User Management System
This is a simple user management system designed for small to medium-sized organizations. It allows administrators to create and manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and update user information.

Usage
To use the system, you will need to log in as an administrator. By default, the system comes with one administrator account:

Username: admin
Password: password
Once you have logged in, you can create new user accounts, manage existing accounts, and assign roles and permissions as needed. The system also includes basic reporting functionality to help you track user activity and identify potential security threats.
